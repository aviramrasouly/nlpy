I would like this to be a program to take csv files from pLink as input and 
then output a list of cross-link totals both from a single run and as a running count
from many runs. The same cross-link found multiple times would have to be returned only 
once, however between runs the residue order may change.

Don't know how I'm going to do this. But here's a file I opened so I can practice 
communicating via GitHub with Ilya.
